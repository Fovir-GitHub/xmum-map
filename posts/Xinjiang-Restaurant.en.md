# Xinjiang Restaurant

## Manager's Words

I want to bring you the most authentic Xinjiang cuisine (la tiao zi, mutton skewers, fried pork, and dry stir-fried noodles).

All dishes are freshly cooked and stir-fried, guaranteeing freshness (only rou jia mo and braised beef are made in the morning, not left overnight).
