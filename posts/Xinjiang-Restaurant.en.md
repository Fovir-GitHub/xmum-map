# Xinjiang Restaurant

## Manager's Words

I want to bring the most authentic Xinjiang cuisine (la tiao zi, lamb skewers, fried pork, and dry stir-fried noodles) to everyone.

All dishes are freshly cooked and stir-fried, guaranteeing freshness (only Roujiamo and braised beef are made in the morning, not left overnight).
