Welcome to this website! To help students more easily access information about nearby stores, this website regularly collects and organizes relevant information (the update date will be displayed at the bottom of the page, and each update will be announced in the announcement).

1. To maximize the display of XMUM and Bell information, this website has **simplified the map layout and relative geographic locations**.

2. This website promises **not to make subjective evaluations of any store** and only provides information.
3. All information is sourced from **information provided by certain merchants and public sources such as Google**.
4. The content on this website is for reference only. Please refer to the actual store for details (such as business hours, prices, discounts, menu items, etc.).
